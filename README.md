# YOLOV3-OBJECT-DETECTION

Detection of small objects like cars, books, etc using the YOLO (You only Look Once) version 3 algorithm and open CV with the use of coco dataset.

YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once, Version 3) is a real-time object detection algorithm that identifies specific objects in videos, live feeds, or images. The YOLO machine learning algorithm uses features learned by a deep convolutional neural network to detect an object. Versions 1-3 of YOLO were created by Joseph Redmon and Ali Farhadi, and the third version of the YOLO machine learning algorithm is a more accurate version of the original ML algorithm. The first version of YOLO was created in 2016, and version 3, which is discussed extensively in this article, was made two years later in 2018. YOLOv3 is an improved version of YOLO and YOLOv2. YOLO is implemented using the Keras or OpenCV deep learning libraries.
